description: "While components are one of the best things that have happened to the frontend development workflow, reusability and scalability become difficult things to manage as your codebase and team grows.

In this workshop, we will cover cutting edge techniques, design patterns and anti-patterns, and best practices that you need to consider for component reusability and more.

By the end of the workshop, you will have a solid foundation of what it takes to create components that are reusable, scales well, and resilient to change."
